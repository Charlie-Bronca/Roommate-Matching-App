if we want to save the review form to database we need a database -- we already have it.
Within the route handler, i have to replace the console.log code To save(). "the review data to your database using the defined model".(this line is for me only) 

what i understand but its not working --

1- First i have to import the review Model :
const Review = require('./models/review'); // Import your review model

2- Then we have to replace the console.log method to save() using the code:

app.post("/submit_review", async function (req, res) {
    try {
        // Extract relevant data from the request body
        const reviewData = {
            text: req.body['review-text'],
            // Add other fields as needed
        };

        // Create a new review instance with the submitted data
        const newReview = new Review(reviewData);

        // Save the new review to the database
        const savedReview = await newReview.save();

        // Check if the review was successfully saved
        if (!savedReview) {
            throw new Error("Error saving review data");
        }

        // Send a response back to the client indicating success
        res.status(200).send("Review submitted successfully");
    } catch (err) {
        // Handle errors
        console.error("Error submitting review:", err.message);
        res.status(500).send("Internal server error");
    }
});
